Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Example 1:

Input: 

3

1 2 3

2

1 1

Output: 

1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 

And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.

You need to output 1.

Constraints:

1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4

0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4

1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^31 - 1

code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int n,m;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int a[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
    }
    scanf("%d",&m);
    int b[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d",&b[i]);
    }
    int i=0;
    int j=0;
    int c=0;
    while(i<n && j<m){
        if(b[j]>=a[i]){
            c++;
            i++;
        }j++;
    }
    printf("%d",c);
}

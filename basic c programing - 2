The candidate is eligible

 

Test Case 2

 

Input

 

50   80   80

 

Output

 

The candidate is eligible

code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int a,b,c;
    scanf("%d",&a);
    scanf("%d",&b);
    scanf("%d",&c);
    if((a>=65 && b>=55 && c>=50) || (a+b+c)>=180){
        printf("The candidate is eligible");
    }
    else{
        printf("The candidate is not eligible");
    }
    
}

Two numbers M and N are passed as the input. A number X is also passed as the input. The program must print the numbers divisible by X from N to M (inclusive of M and N).

 

Input Format:


The first line denotes the value of M
The second line denotes the value of N
The third line denotes the value of X

 

Output Format:


Numbers divisible by X from N to M, with each number separated by a space.

 

Boundary Conditions:


1 <= M <= 9999999
M < N <= 9999999
1 <= X <= 9999

 

Example Input/Output 1:


Input:
2
40
7

 

Output:
35 28 21 14 7

121 110 99 88 77 66

code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int m,n,x;
    scanf("%d %d %d",&m,&n,&x);
    for(int i=n;i>=m;i--){
        if(i%x==0){
            printf("%d ",i);
        }
    }
    return 0;
